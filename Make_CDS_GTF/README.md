For now, this is giving erros. I will copy the scripts I have into this repository, but they have not run successfully. Locally, I get an error because of boolean series. On Docker, I get an error saying the action I'm trying to take is illegal, and on Apptainer, I get an error related to gtfparse (something about seq)
