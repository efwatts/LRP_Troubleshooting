# LRP_Troubleshooting
learning LRP pipeline &amp; troubleshooting automation

# This repository is for me to house original files & scripts
I also want to add my own scripts & modify original scripts to reflect any updates that have happened since it was written.

# The general flow of the pipeline (so far) is this
Iso-Seq --> SQANTI3 --> CPAT --> ORF Calling --> Refine

# The generic input files required (so far) are these
raw_reads.ccs.bam
primers.fasta
assembly_genome.fasta
annotated_genome.gtf
PG_reference_table.tsv
Human_Hexamer.tsv (this one is specific)
Human_logitModel.RData (also specific)
