# LRP_Troubleshooting
learning LRP pipeline &amp; troubleshooting automation

## This repository is for me to house original files & scripts
I also want to add my own scripts & modify original scripts to reflect any updates that have happened since it was written.

## The general flow of the pipeline (so far) is this
Iso-Seq --> SQANTI3 --> CPAT --> ORF Calling --> Refine

## The generic input files required (so far) are these <br />
- raw_reads.ccs.bam <br /> 
- primers.fasta <br />
- assembly_genome.fasta <br />
- annotated_genome.gtf <br />
- PG_reference_table.tsv <br />
- Human_Hexamer.tsv (this one is specific) <br />
- Human_logitModel.RData (also specific) <br />
